# Deep_Learning_with_Keras
Irrigation machine is a data set of automated watering of parcels. The datset is composed of 2000 different samples which contains 20 sensors and 3 parcels. We will use a multi-label classification method to which is implemented in Keras package. 
Multi-label classification problems differ from multi-class problems in that each observation can be labeled with zero or more classes. So classes are not mutually exclusive.

List of contents:
1  Multi-label classification
2  A combination of callbacks
3  choosing the optimum activation functions
4  Hyperparameter tuning
5  Learning curves

This project shows how to solve a variety of problems using the versatile Keras functional API. We start with simple, multi-layer dense networks (also known as multi-layer perceptrons), and continue on to more complicated architectures.  We used advanced topics such as category embeddings and multiple-output networks.
