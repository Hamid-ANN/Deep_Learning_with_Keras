# Deep_Learning_with_Keras
Irrigation machine is a data set of automated watering of parcels. The datset is composed of 2000 different samples which contains 20 sensors and 3 parcels. We will use a multi-label classification method to which is implemented in Keras package. 
Multi-label classification problems differ from multi-class problems in that each observation can be labeled with zero or more classes. So classes are not mutually exclusive.
